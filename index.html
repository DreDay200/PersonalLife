Im also deeping into music and i signed up for the software development to further my education and learn how i can make the both of them come together and build a career such as creating different web pages and later graphic design to help artists and labels to market themselves better. </p>

          <h4> Welcome to my page. </h4>
          <p> I joined Correlation One to further my knowledge and gain a better career for myself. I do music production and im hoping to find a way to blend them together to create something fit for me. Along the journey so far i've learn to code using HTML to build web structures and lead into CSS to design better.</p>
